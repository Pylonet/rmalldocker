# Welcome to rmalldocker
This tool was created for users who have several containers and want to automatically delete them directly.

## How to use?

1) First download the `rmalldocker.sh`

or you can do this:

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pylonet/rmalldocker/main/rmalldocker.sh?token=GHSAT0AAAAAACQCRHUR3FBBCTPP5GDKNGBUZRM423A
```

2) Once you have the file you can move it to your `/opt/` folder and give it run permissions

```
mv rmalldocker.sh /opt/
```

```
chmod +x rmalldocker.sh
```

3) You can add rmalldocker in your zshrc (PATH)
